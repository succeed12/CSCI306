This document serves the purpose of desribing the pieces and what they do. 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-Implements Drawable (no interaction and not actually a game piece, so doesn't extend GamePiece)
	-Grass
-Extends GamePiece, implements Moveable
	-Imp and Wind.  
		-Moves right (jumping over other pieces) until it reaches the rightmost space. Then moves left (jumping over other pieces) until
		it reaches the leftmost space. Continues in this pattern indefinitely.
	-Sniper and Unicorn move randomly (these would be the fairy and imp in this case)
-Extends GamePiece with various InteractionResult
	-NONE - Bug (same purpose as minion)
	-HIT - Imp (interacts on same location)
	-KILL - Wraith (will kill a player that comes within 2 squares, similar to the Kangalo)
	-ADVANCE - Fairy (Unicorn; interacts on same location)
	-GET_POINT - Castle (Gives a point if the player lands on it, similar to treasure).
